# Batman badge  
Since v0.20, Freecad does not have Image workbench, instead the image features are integrated in `Std Base`. That means that the image commands and tools are now reachable from all the workbenches.  
1. Create a new project  
2. Go to `Part design`  
3. File -> Import (and import the image you want) 
4. Create Body and scketch in the same plane as the image (XY in this project). If not in the middle, change its possition as you wish.  
5. Use the polyline tool to create the shape of the batman badge, draw only half  
6. Tweak it as you want  
7. Such a form should be fully constrained, suggest do not leave any DoF  
8. If using `FreeCAD v0.21` you can fillet or chamfer as you want before mirroring  
9. Mirror the part
